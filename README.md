A comprehensive C implementation of fundamental Numerical Methods algorithms. This project serves as a practical guide to understanding how mathematical problems—such as root finding, integration, and differential equations—are solved computationally.

## 🧮 Project Overview

Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation for the problems of mathematical analysis. This repository contains:
* **Source Code (`.c`):** Efficient implementations of these algorithms in C.
* **Documentation (`.pdf`):** Detailed theoretical background and explanations of the methods used.
* **Executable (`.exe`):** A pre-compiled binary to test the methods immediately.

## 📂 File Structure

* **`Numerical_Methods.c`**: The core source code containing the logic for the numerical algorithms.
* **`Numerical_Methods.pdf`**: A companion document explaining the mathematical theory, formulas, and usage instructions for the code.
* **`Numerical_Methods.exe`**: Compiled Windows executable file.

## ⚙️ Features & Algorithms

* *Note: This code likely implements standard numerical techniques such as:*
    * **Root Finding:** Bisection Method, Newton-Raphson, Secant Method.
    * **Linear Algebra:** Gaussian Elimination, Matrix Inversion.
    * **Integration:** Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Rule.
    * **Interpolation:** Lagrange Polynomials, Splines.
